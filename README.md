# Expense-Tracker
A project to enhance express, node, mongo, react {MERN}, tailwind css skills.
- cd to backend and nodemon server.js.
- cd to frontend in another terminal and npm start.

# FIXES:
- create atlas connection uri instead of local.
- make it a mobile app.
- host it.

- hovering is not showing tooltip information about the current date or the lunch or anything despite being coded.


i like this but i want the category to be dropdown only remove the category input field instead put the category only when food is selected and that category dropdown should have breakfast, lunch, dinner and i want another filter under expenses in which we can filter from which months and after clicking that month all days in the month should come with how much i spent that day if logged, if not logged type Rs.0, I also want the date to come up in the thing when i give add expense after giving the date, and in the calender if i have logged that day put a green color on that day with three small circle dots, each small dots should be normal color when not logged, if breakfast is logged first dot is red, lunch is logged second dot is red, if dinner is logged third dot is red.  upon hovering those red dots, it should say breakfast, lunch or dinner.
