# Expense-Tracker
A project to enhance express, node, mongo, react {MERN}, tailwind css skills.

All your expenses tracked in one website/app. Current days before logging are marked in the calendar as yellow, when logged the calendar turns green, 3 gray dots will turn red when breakfast, lunch, dinner are added respectively.
Can filter the months to see the expenses for that month.
Total expenses for months and yearly expenses can be tracked.
Hosted live on site, can use from mobile as well.

# TODO:
- make it a mobile app.
- hosted it.
- https://expense-tracker-odh7.onrender.com

- hovering is not showing tooltip information about the current date or the lunch or anything despite being coded.
